## Hi, my name is Quang Ba Hai Dang but people know me as Dang Quang ðŸ˜Š

I am a postgraduate in Artificial Intelligence with about 3 years experience in the Advertising and Marketing industry. I am passionate about technology, computer science, and data in general.

My journey to become a data scientist is slightly unusual as my original background was in Digital Marketing space. In my first ever job, I was often surrounded by data daily, yet many times I found decisions were made arbitrarily without understanding the existing data. The problem was that we were surrounded by data but lacked insights. Spending time organizing and preparing data was considered "geeky" and often overlooked in favor of more creative tasks. This got even worse during the emerge of AI chatbot where everyone one seem to be rushing in implementing AI without proper understanding of the technology the core principle behind it.

I wanted to better understand what is behind Artificial Intelligence and when it should be employed, and how other Deep Learning or even Traditional Machine Learning techniques can help address problems. Thus, I decided to return to university for my master's degree in AI. I created this page to record mainly three things:
- My research notes and understanding of AI research.
- Helpful tips and guides during my learning journey.
- My personal takes on the current human-AI fields.
